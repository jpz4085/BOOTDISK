				BOOTDISK: Flash Drive Formatting Tool
				*************************************
				
ABOUT

This utility consists of a set of BASH scripts that will automatically configure removable media using
GPT or MBR partition schemes and format with FAT16/32, exFAT or NTFS and the required bootstrapping code to
enable startup on UEFI and BIOS systems. It provides functionality similar to the Rufus USB Tool for Windows.

Main Menu:
==========

FreeDOS 1.3 – Create a boot disk containing a basic set of utilities like FDISk,FORMAT,SYS,EDIT,etc.

MS-DOS 8.0 – Create a boot disk using the DOS version included with Windows from XP to 8.1.
These files are not included with BOOTDISK so this option must be enabled from the Tools sub-menu.

Windows – Create bootable Windows media and optionally extract an ISO image to the disk.
When using exFAT or NTFS format the disk can be made UEFI bootable using the UEFI:NTFS bootloader.
When using FAT32 format the script will split the install.wim archive, if larger than four gigabytes,
provided the wimtools are available. Otherwise a compatibility warning will be displayed.

UEFI Shell - Create a boot disk using the pre-built UEFI Shell image provided by Pete Batard.

Tools Menu:
===========

Extract MS-DOS 8.0: Provide the path to the diskcopy.dll library from the Windows\SysWOW64 folder
on a working system or the same location in the sources\install.wim archive on install media.

Download an ISO file using Fido: Download official retail Windows ISOs and UEFI Shell ISOs using
the same PowerShell script employed by Rufus. Files are saved to the active user's Downloads folder.
 
Custom Windows installation: Automatically create a local account, configure privacy/data collection
settings, use the current language and timezone settings, skip wireless network setup, and disable
automatic BitLocker encryption. Disable the mandatory Microsoft account screen and bypass the
hardware requirements (TPM/Secure Boot/RAM) for Windows 11.

Notes:
======

When entering file and folder paths at the prompts they should not contain any quotes so copy and
paste the file into terminal but don't drag and drop. This will avoid invalid path errors.

Requirements:
=============

Common packages: p7zip, mtools, chntpw, powershell, and jq (JSON processor).

Linux packages: curl, ms-sys, exfat-fuse, exfa-progs, ntfs-3g and wimtools.
Note that if ms-sys is omitted the tool will create UEFI bootable media only.
Also your account should be a member of the "disk" group to allow unprivileged device access.
Sudo is only used where mandatory.

macOS packages: bash (above version 3.2) and wimlib.
These can be installed using the MacPorts or Homebrew package managers.
Additionally ms-sys can be used for legacy EXFAT booting and sgdisk for GPT partitioning.
Note that NTFS is not supported at this time.
