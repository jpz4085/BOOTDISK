				BOOTDISK: Flash Drive Formatting Tool
				*************************************
				
ABOUT

This utility consists of a set of BASH scripts that will automatically configure removable media using
GPT or MBR partition schemes and format with FAT16/32, exFAT or NTFS and the required bootstrapping code to
enable startup on UEFI and BIOS systems. It provides functionality similar to the Rufus USB Tool for Windows.

Main Menu:
==========

FreeDOS 1.3 – Create a boot disk containing a basic set of utilities like FDISK,FORMAT,SYS,EDIT,etc.

MS-DOS 8.0 – Create a boot disk using the DOS version included with Windows from XP to 8.1.
These files are not included with BOOTDISK so this option must be enabled from the Tools sub-menu.

Windows – Create bootable Windows media and optionally extract an ISO image to the disk.
Create bootable Windows to Go media from an ISO image using the wimtools and bcd-sys scripts.
When using exFAT or NTFS format the disk can be made UEFI bootable using the UEFI:NTFS bootloader.
When using FAT32 format the script will split the install.wim archive when necessary provided the
wimtools are available. Otherwise a file system compatibility warning will be displayed.

UEFI Shell - Create a boot disk using the pre-built UEFI Shell image provided by Pete Batard.

Tools Menu:
===========

Extract MS-DOS 8.0: Provide the path to the diskcopy.dll library from the Windows\SysWOW64 folder
on a working system or the same location in the sources\install.wim archive on install media.

Download an ISO file using Fido: Download official retail Windows ISOs and UEFI Shell ISOs using
the same PowerShell script employed by Rufus. Fido can prompt for each parameter or all arguments
can be passed on a single command line. Files are saved to the active user's Downloads folder.

Verify a Windows ISO checksum: Calculate the SHA-1 value for a Windows DVD image and search for it in
the sha1.rg-adguard.net databases. A match confirms you have an original and unmodified Microsoft ISO.
 
Custom Windows installation: Automatically create a local account, configure privacy/data collection
settings, use the current language and timezone settings, skip wireless network setup, and disable
automatic BitLocker encryption. Disable the mandatory Microsoft account screen and bypass the
hardware requirements (TPM/Secure Boot/RAM) for Windows 11.

Troubleshooting:
================

When entering file and folder paths at the prompts they should not contain any quotes so just paste
the file, folder or path into terminal but don't drag and drop. This will avoid invalid path errors.

The main script will warn if critical dependencies are absent but not optional components. Review
the list of requirements below and install anything needed to provide missing functionality.

When using the Fido download script you may receive a error stating "Some users, entities and locations
are banned from using this service" if you or a previous user with the same external IP address accessed
the Microsoft servers in rapid succession. The solution is to wait at least a full 24 hours before making
another attempt then use the Fido command line option (not interactive mode) to download the ISO.

When creating Windows to Go media under Linux the terminal may suddenly be killed by the userspace out
of memory killer (systemd-oomd) as indicated in the logs. This happens most frequently under the GNOME
desktop environment. This will require increasing the Memory Pressure Limit to 80% and increasing the
Memory Pressure Duration to one minute if the default values are lower on the systemd-oomd service and
the systemd user environment service (user@service). The vendor defaults can be overridden with drop-
in configuration files as indicated in the repository Notes file and Linux documentation.

Requirements:
=============

Common packages: p7zip, mtools, hivex, bcd-sys, powershell and jq (JSON processor).

Linux packages: curl, ms-sys, exfat-progs, ntfs-3g and wimtools.
Note that if ms-sys is omitted the tool will create UEFI bootable media only.
Also your account should be a member of the "disk" group to allow unprivileged device access.
Sudo is only used where mandatory.

macOS packages: bash (above version 3.2), wimlib and NTFS write support.
These can be installed using the MacPorts or Homebrew package managers.
Optional components include ms-sys for legacy EXFAT and NTFS booting and sgdisk for GPT partitioning.
NTFS install media requires the Tuxera or Paragon products while Windows to Go supports NTFS-3G.
