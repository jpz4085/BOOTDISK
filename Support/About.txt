				BOOTDISK: Flash Drive Formatting Tool
				*************************************
				
ABOUT

This utility consists of a set of BASH scripts that will automatically partition and format removable
media such as flash drives with FAT16/32, exFAT or NTFS and the required bootstrapping code to enable
startup on UEFI and BIOS systems. It provides some functionality like the Rufus USB Tool for Windows.

Available selections:
=====================

FreeDOS 1.2 – Create a boot disk containing a basic set of utilities like FDISk,FORMAT,SYS,EDIT,etc.

MS-DOS 8.0 – Create a boot disk using the DOS version included with Windows XP to 8.1. The DOS system
files must be extracted from the diskcopy.dll library using the option provided in the Tools sub-menu.
This file can be found under the Windows\SysWOW64 folder on a working system and the same location in
the sources\install.wim archive on install media. These files are not included with BOOTDISK.

Windows – Create bootable Windows installation media using GPT or MBR partition schemes and optionally
extract an ISO image to the disk. Under Linux the ISO file path must not contain single quotes so copy
and paste the file into terminal but don't drag and drop. When using exFAT or NTFS format the disk can
be made UEFI bootable using UEFI:NTFS which is downloaded automatically when launching the main script.

UEFI Shell - Create a boot disk using the pre-built UEFI Shell image provided by Pete Batard.

Tools Menu - This sub-menu provides options to enable MS-DOS 8.0 support and download Windows and UEFI
Shell ISO files using the Fido script. This requires PowerShell and is the same feature used by Rufus.

Requirements:
=============

Supported on Linux and macOS with the appropriate packages installed as listed below.

Linux requires curl, p7zip, ms-sys, mtools, exfat-fuse, exfat-utils and ntfs-3g. See the documentation
for your distribution. If no legacy boot support if desired for some reason then ms-sys can be omitted
and the tool will create UEFI bootable media only. Your account should be a member of the "disk" group
to allow unprivileged device access.

macOS requires p7zip, mtools and bash (above version 3.2). These can be installed using the MacPorts or
Homebrew package managers. Additionally ms-sys can be used for legacy EXFAT boot support and sgdisk for
GPT partitioning. Apple provides no native NTFS formatting or write support so neither does the script.
