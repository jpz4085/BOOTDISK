Version History:

Version 0.1  Basic functionality:  Records the boot sector, 1 FAT table,
             and the root directory into a "storage location" near the end
             of the disk.  On this version, if any data is near the end of
             the disk it will be overwritten.  A future version of this
             program will solve this problem.

Version 0.2  Buffers are now dynamically created thereby reducing the size
             of the executable.  

             After testing it became apparent that the image is usually 
             stored between the end of a logical drive and the beginning
             of the next partition on a hard disk.  (This was true on version
             0.1.)  FAT table modifications will still need to be made on a
             floppy disk.

             Modified the code so that the space used by the mirror image 
             is marked as reserved in the FAT tables, if necessary.
             (Currently works only on FAT-16 file systems.)

             Added code to save a backup of the partition tables on the A:
             drive by using MIRROR /PARTN.  (MIRROR /P works too!)  The
             partition tables are stored in a file named "partnsav.fil"  The
             partnsav.fil is not compatible with MS-DOS's; but will be 
             recoverable with UNFORMAT version 0.8, to be released shortly.
             For information regarding the format of the partnsav.fil, please
             see the documentation in the source code.

             Added the /? switch to display the help screen.
